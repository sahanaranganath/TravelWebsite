# TravelWebsite
VentureIntoADV is a travel booking website which involves looking for places, checking out optimal prices for packages to visit places and booking for the same.  We have sections that enlighten the visitor with the culture, history and information about many places around the globe. We have sections that help the visitor understand popular places that people like to visit so that the viewer isn’t burdened by the confusion of choices. This implies that VentureIntoADV is not just a website that helps with booking but its basic motive is to make the visitor’s job easier.   Once the visitor is able to decide which package they are interested in they will be taken to the contact and payments sections, where they can easily book the trip of their choice 

Refer the website_report document to get a cpmplete overview.

For connecting the databases import 

Database name: demo 
Table name: loginform 
Import "loginform.sql" 
----------------------------------------
Database name: php_connection
Table name: table1
Import "contact.sql" 
----------------------------------------
Database name: travel_display
Table name: table1
Import "packages.sql" 
----------------------------------------

You can use all these under a single database also. 
You'll just have to make respective changes in the connection.php
Connectiontocontact.php
and login.php files.


Using them under one DB is THE MOST OPTIMAL WAY. 
I will be uploading the the edited files soon.
